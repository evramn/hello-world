# hello-world
I am learning the piano because I dislike the piano, it's my least favorite instrument and yet it is the first one I'm ever learning.
I am learning it because I believe it to be the central point of all music. THE instrument, if you will. Even so, I don't like how it sounds. 
However, I have set out on this quest to generate a more intimate understanding of the piano, because I respect it and its impact on the musical world.
